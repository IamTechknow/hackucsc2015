Small plants may produce a single yellow daisy-like flower head on a single stem, while larger plants have a rigid main stem and lateral branches that grow to the height of the main stem and produce many flowers. It is coated with a sticky, resinous material that helps to retard water loss during the heat of the day and may also help to repel potential predators.'+
		'<a href="http://www.watsonvillewetlandswatch.org/plants.htm#ElkhornSlough">*</a></p>'+
		'<p><b>Where to find it:</b> It typically grows on deep loam and sandy loam soils with a subsurface clay component, which hold moisture longer into the growing season compared to the surrounding sandy soils. It is frequently associated with non-native grasses such as wild oat, barley, rattlesnake grass, vulpia, and bromes. Native associates include rushes, California oatgrass, and other tarplants. '+

		'<p><b>Interesting Fact:</b> Its beautiful flower heads color the otherwise dry fields of mid summer, attracting an interesting array of pollinators.'+

		'Characteristics: This plant is one of the most common plants growing in freshwater wetlands. It has long, flat light-green leaves and creeping roots. The flowers are at the end of a long stalk that looks like a hot dog on a stick. The fuzzy down that hangs on the cattails carries the seeds in the wind. </p>'+
		'Where to find it: Cattails grow in fresh water in every finger of the Watsonville Slough system. '+
		'Life cycle: It flowers from June to July '+
		'Cultural uses: The leaves were used for weaving mats for houses. Native Americans made toy cattail dolls. Please see our statement on the use of plants.'+
		'Interesting fact: Look closely when you walk by a colony of cattails. Cattails provide habitat and food for many nesting birds, muskrats and other animals.'+
